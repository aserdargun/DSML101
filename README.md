ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Serdar Gundogdu. (Mechanical and Industrial Engineer)
<p>Iâ€™m interested in Python and Data Science. I have a good understanding on Python. I try to become a Data Scientist. I enrolled Data Science Certification Program and I am planning to take certificate in January 2023.

I have completed 139 hours of [@fredbaptiste](https://github.com/fbaptiste) - [Python Deep Dive series](https://github.com/aserdargun/python-deepdive) in [UDEMY](https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?src=ukw&q=%22fred+baptiste%22) courses. You can find below aggregated and rewritten Jupyter Notebook Files.
