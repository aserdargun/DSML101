ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aserdargun. Iâ€™m interested in Python and Data Science.

I'm a student of Fred Baptiste <a href="https://github.com/fbaptiste" target="_blank">(@fbaptiste)</a> who is tutoring Python Deep Dive Series on Udemy. I will be sharing my special hints from Deep Dive series by using Google Colab Notebook.
I had a good understanding on Python before. On the other hand, I wanted to go far beyond this. Till now, I have completed these courses below.
