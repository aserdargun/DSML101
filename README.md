ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aserdargun. Iâ€™m interested in Python and Data Science. Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science

I'm a student of Fred Baptiste who is tutoring Python Deep Dive Series on Udemy. I will be sharing hints from Deep Dive series by using Google Colab Notebook.
I had a good understanding on Python before. On the other hand, I wanted to go far beyond this. Till now, I have completed these courses below.
* Python 3: <a href="link">Deep Dive (Part 1 - Functional) </a> Udemy Course which length is 44.5 hours.
* Python 3: Deep Dive (Part 2 - Iteration, Generators) Udemy Course which length is 36 hours.
* Python 3: Python 3: Deep Dive (Part 3 - Hash Maps) Udemy Course which length is 22 hours.
and I am carrying on Python 3: Deep Dive (Part 4 - OOP) Udemy Course which length is 36.5 hours. Percent of 40 was completed. After a while, I will start sharing my reviews and wrap-up on this MyPythonCheetSheet file.

I will attend Data Science Certification Program and I am planning to take certificate in January 2023.
Stay Tuned...
