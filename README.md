ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aserdargun. Iâ€™m interested in Python and Data Science. Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science

I'm a student of Fred Baptiste <a href=https://github.com/fbaptiste>(@fbaptiste)</a> who is tutoring Python Deep Dive Series on Udemy. I will be sharing hints from Deep Dive series by using Google Colab Notebook.
I had a good understanding on Python before. On the other hand, I wanted to go far beyond this. Till now, I have completed these courses below.
* <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-3-deep-dive-part-1/?referralCode=E46B931C71EE01845062/">Python 3: Deep Dive (Part 1 - Functional)</a> Udemy Course which length is 44.5 hours.
* <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-3-deep-dive-part-2/?referralCode=3E7AFEF5174F04E5C8D4/">Python 3: Deep Dive (Part 2 - Iteration, Generators)</a> Udemy Course which length is 36 hours.

and I am carrying on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-3-deep-dive-part-4/?referralCode=3BB758BE4C04FB983E6F/">Python 3: Deep Dive (Part 4 - OOP)</a> Udemy Course which length is 36.5 hours. Percent of 40 was completed. After a while, I will start sharing my reviews and wrap-up on this MyPythonCheetSheet file.

I will attend Data Science Certification Program and I am planning to take certificate in January 2023.
Stay Tuned...
